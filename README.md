# CS 320 Portfolio Artifacts

## Overview

This repository contains selected artifacts from my CS 320 coursework, showcasing my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance.

### Project One: Contact Service

**File Submitted:**
- `Contact.java`

This file demonstrates my ability to create a contact management class with validation to ensure data integrity. The `Contact` class ensures that contact IDs are unique and non-null, and that fields such as the name, phone number, and address adhere to specific format and length constraints.

### Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report

This report provides a detailed overview of the unit testing strategies and experiences applied during the development of the mobile application for Grand Strand Systems. It includes reflections on the effectiveness of the JUnit tests and the methodologies used to ensure code quality.

## Reflection

1. **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

   To ensure my code is functional and secure, I implement comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests that cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases. This helps verify that all components work as expected and meet the requirements. I also follow secure coding practices such as validating inputs and handling exceptions to prevent vulnerabilities.

2. **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

   I interpret user needs by thoroughly analyzing the project requirements and understanding the goals of the end-users. I translate these needs into functional specifications and ensure the design and implementation meet these specifications, maintaining a user-centered approach throughout the development process.

3. **How do I approach designing software?**

   My approach to designing software involves breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable components and using object-oriented principles to create modular and reusable code. I also consider scalability and maintainability, ensuring the software can evolve as user needs change.

## Conclusion

The artifacts in this repository demonstrate my proficiency in software development and testing, highlighting my ability to build reliable, secure, and user-centered applications.
